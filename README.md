# Centric Server

### A programmable automation server

## Installation

### Install centric

```
$ npm install -g centric
```

#### Option 1 - Use centic scaffold

centric scaffold will create a basic centric project with examples that you can modify to suit your needs.

- Run the below command in the folder you want to create the project.
```
$ centric scaffold
```

- After that, start the server using the command:

```
$ centric start
```

And your done!

#### Option 2 - Create the files yourself

Folder Structure for a centric project.

```
    .
    ├── services               # Service Files
    ├── tasks                  # Task Files
    ├── config.js              # Configuration file

```

## Services

The services folder contains all your projects service files. A service file has the following signature.

```javascript
module.exports = async function ({ config }) {
  // Service Logic goes here...
  const testLogging = function () {
    console.log('this is a test')
  }

  return { testLogging }
}
```

Services are useful for any logic you wish to share between tasks (like a database connection).

## Creating a new task

Create a new file in the tasks folder that matches the following signature.

> The name of the task in the centric web interface is equivalent to the name of the task file name.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  description: 'task description', // Viewable in the web UI
  locks: null,
  defaultData: function () {
    // Return the default data for the task.
    // This will be the default "taskData" in the run method.
    return {}
  },
  run: async function ({ config, services, opData, saveOpData, taskData, saveTaskData, logInfo, logWarning, logError, isCancelled }) {
    // Run method is called when the task is executed.
    // Logic for the task goes here.
  }
}
```

The run method provides following listed parameters:

| Argument | Description |
| --- | --- |
| config | configuration exported from config.js |
| services | object containing all exported values from all service files |
| opData | Current running task's operation-data. |
| saveOpData | Method to be called to save the curremt operation data. |
| taskData | Task data of the current running task. |
| saveTaskData | Method to be called to save the current running task data. |
| logInfo | logInfo is method to log the info entry showing information log of the operation. |
| logWarning | logWarning is method to log the warnings entry showing warnings of the operation. |
| logError | logError is method to log the errors entry showing errors of the operation. |
| isCancelled | Method to check whether the task is active for running or has been cancelled. |
